Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding.

Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one.

Ask questions one at a time. For each question:
- Present your recommended answer first, with a brief justification, then list alternatives
- Provide 2-4 concrete options
- Use the AskUserQuestion tool so I can select or override

Track decisions as you go — if a later answer invalidates an earlier one, flag the conflict and revisit.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.
